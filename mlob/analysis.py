    This function calculates the maximum shear and moment at each analysis node
    in one or two spans of equal or unequal lengths. This is accomplished by
    iterating through each analysis node, at each analysis node each axle of
    vehicle is placed on the analysis node and the location of all the other
    axles is determined, the moment and shear are calculated for this instance of
    axle locations. This operation is repeated for each axle of the vehicle and
    for each analysis node. The axles are incremented left to right and right to
    left to cover all possible axle locations in either direction.

        Placing each axle directly at the analysis node ensures that the maximum
        shear and moment is calculated for each axle and corresponding axle
        locations. While the maximum shear and moment will be calculated for that
        specific analysis node location, the overall maximum shear and moment of the
        span may not be calculated if there is not enough discretization of analysis
        nodes, i.e. not enough analysis nodes in the span to accurately describe the
        shear and moment behavior.

        the node included and load excluded.

        Effectively this considers the load at the analysis node to be just
        to the right or left of the analysis node to accurately capture the
        effects of shear on each side of the node.

        The load occuring directly at the analysis node is effectively a
        discontinuity in the shear force. To overcome the discontinuity the
        program looks at the shear force just before and just after the 
        load at the analysis node.
