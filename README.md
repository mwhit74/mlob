This program calculates the shear and moment induced in a simply supported beam
with a constant moment of area (moment of inertia) along the span length. Each
axle is placed at each node (critial section) and the location of the other axles
is calculated. The shear on each side of the node is calculated and the moment at each node is
calculated. 

By placing the axle at each node it ensures that the maximum forces are
calculated at those nodes. 

This program uses a functional programming paradigm approach.
